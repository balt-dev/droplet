AppBuilder that you build to start the engine

State trait that gets a `fn tick(&mut self, ctx: &mut AppContext, delta: Duration)`

AppContext
- Registries of various asset types
- Hooks into window stuff
- Input should be handled in a sane way allowing both keyboard and mouse
- Trait-driven basically everything
